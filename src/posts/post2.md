# Second Post

## First Heading
Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. We'll do another happy little painting. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.

## Second Heading
This piece of canvas is your world. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. A beautiful little sunset.

## Third Heading
Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. This painting comes right out of your heart. With practice comes confidence. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind.
