# Third Post

## First Heading
Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. In your world you can create anything you desire. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.

## Second Heading
Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect.

## Third Heading
Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Just use the old one inch brush.
